## Description

I remember walking around Sydney one day a while ago, and I saw what I thought was a guy doing an alien cosplay driving a really cool car with the number plate NCC58D.
Well now, with the alien invasion and all, I've realised that he wasn't doing a cosplay, he actually was a real alien! I asked around, and apparently he has moved states since then, but we need to track him down!
I'm sure you can find the answer somewhere on the internet, his car is REALLY cool after all.

The flag format is as follows: BEGINNER{NCC58D}, where NCC58D is replaced by his new number plate.

## Difficulty

- Easy

### Idea

Simple OSINT leveraging social media.

### Walkthrough

Google search for NCC58D leads to this facebook post:

We know now that this car is the "Only Mansory Lamborghini Urus in Australia"

Searching for "mansory urus australia" on google or a variety of social media websites results in images containing the new numberplate.
