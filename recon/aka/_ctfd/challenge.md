Through advanced reconnaissance, we have discovered the ssh credentials to an officer's machine. Exploit these credentials to gain access to the machine and collect critical operations intelligence.

You can access this challenge via ssh. Command: `ssh officer@pwn.ctf.secso.cc -p 2200` and password `iCANTstandROOKIES1337`.
(There are 3 flags on this machine, if you find one try submitting it on `tron` and `welcome` too)
