WARNING!!! THIS CHALLENGE IS HARD (i think)!!!

We have been intercepting the alien communications, and it seems they are using an old, cryptographically insecure hashing function with constraints as a means of encrypting their messages...
Using the intercepted data, we have created a small testing program. Using the source code for this program, determine which input string will pass the checks in place. 

NOTE: in theory there is only one flag, but if you think you solved the challenge and we keep rejecting the flag, shoot a message to @captainboggle on Discord for help!
