OHNOOOOO the alien's have arrived!!!! Some of the smartest, most driven, most grittiest girty human's alive (and dead) have created the THE_GREATEST_alien_encryptor9000x37 and have began conversing with the aliens. It seems like the alien's have recieved our messages but unfortunately we haven't made a decryptor yet :( The smartest, most driven, most grittiest grity human's are unfortunately touring the world as they gave up the language of aliens for the language of music. It is now up to you to decrypt the message we recieved!! Can you do it!?!? It looks something like this: `BFACFABCFADFBCDFBCDFACFBEF{ABCEF3_ABF0ACDFacf_1bcdf_EF3AFabfacf?}`.
