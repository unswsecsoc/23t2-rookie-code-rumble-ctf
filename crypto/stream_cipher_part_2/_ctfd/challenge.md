This is part 2 of the stream cipher challenge.

You have retrieved the ciphertext from earlier in such a short time that your partner is still skeptical of your skills. Hence, he dares you to recover the encryption's secret key before forming a team. To make it more challenging, he gives you a set of possible keys to choose from. You would like to take up the challenge and prove your cryptography prowess by cracking the code.
