ASIO has broken into an alien military network, and discovered that these aliens use what appears to be a modified version of Overwatch PvE to determine the ranks of newly enlisted soldiers. ASIO can see that higher ranking officers are granted immediate clearence to sensitive data, so they need someone to place highly using the stolen software in order to gain more intel on the aliens. After reviewing every Aussie steam account, ASIO has chosen you for the task. Good luck!
