Hello, and welcome to SecSoc beginner CTF!

(Side note: You might want to read through this with your whole team so that everyone is in the loop)

This CTF uses dynamic scoring. This means that all challenges will initially be valued at 100 points, and
will decrease in point value as more people solve them. This means the challenges with less solves will
give you more points (note that solving a challenge first will give you 100 points, but you will lose
points as other people solve it).

Here are some easier challenges to get you started:

- Welcome (recon)
- unidentified-driving-object (recon)
- Extraterrestrial Contact (misc)
- Headquarters (misc)
