I was writing a really cool CTF challenge, but when the aliens attacked, they installed some sort of virus on my computer, and all my files got encrypted, including the challenge!
Here is the encrypted flag file, I guess you can have the points for the challenge if you manage to get it unlocked for me...
Oh, and they also left this ransom note, I guess it might come in handy?
